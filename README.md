# ExampleComponents

## Introduction

This is a basic component library for JSML.  It can be used as a template for starting
JSML projects.

## Build

To translate the JSML code into Julia, simply run the `juliasim` compiler,
_e.g.,_:

```
$ juliasim compile .
```

Once built, you can commit the generated code to the `git` repository and/or
publish this code in a registry as a normal Julia package.
